## Start your online Bachelor degree in Data Science
**The most important economic and social development of our times is digitalisation. Digital technology not only fills all areas of interpersonal communication, but also has an important influence on our economy. It represents existing forms of technology, while paving the way for new business models that were not previously possible. Its distinguishing feature is the consistent use of data - no matter where, no matter when. Data Science is therefore at the core of all digitalisation processes. Study data science to get started on a rewarding and highly in-demand career path!**

***The online Bachelor's degree in Data Science covers data preparation, visualisation, and analysis; everything you need to know in order to launch a career in the field. You’ll learn to take a methodical, focused, and logical approach to data science problems, and the focus on practical problem-solving skills will have you ready for your future professional challenges, with confidence.***

# Software-Development  [![The CyberPolyglot](https://img.shields.io/badge/The%20CyberPolyglot-red?logoColor=FFD700)](#github-repositories)

Software systems are an inseparable part of the today’s business and economic world, as well as everyday life. Regardless of its through smartphone apps, smart home devices or complex online databases, software developers and the work that they do have a profound effect on the world.

The Open Source online Bachelor’s study programme in Software Development establishes knowledge in three major areas related to computer science:

- Software engineering (with courses covering data security and protection, IT service management and requirements engineering)

- Programming and technology skills (with courses covering cloud programming, app and web-based development, data modelling and database systems)

- Methodological work skills (with courses covering IT project management and methods of agile software development)

***Once you’ve developed your foundations in all three areas, you’ll get a chance to explore more nuance topics according to your interest, from a wide range of electives focusing on artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and Robotics and Production Engineering.***

This programme includes an AI prompt engineering course, so you can learn how to use tools like ChatGPT best in your everyday life, work, and studies.
